Each work begins from a dream – a simple desire, a wish. Based on ficticious characters, everyday objects are removed from their normal contexts and functions in an atttempt to physically realise a unfulfilled childhood fantasy or dream. The desk being a common place from which dreams are first imagined and take flight, is used as the starting point of the transformation. However, these works are undertaken in the knowledge that this is a furtile attempt to recapture a dream one had as an child ? a wish of flight ;a refuge within a crystal cave… The enormous amount of effort expended in the pursuit of these seemingly unachievable goals is poignant specifically because it symbolises a childlike optimism and hope that despite «unsurpassable» odds, illustrate the faith the aforementioned characters have in their dreams eventually taking flight.
