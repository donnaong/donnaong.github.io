Against the backdrop of an archetypal garden, the theme of hope is narrated and illuminated through the hauntingly familiar figure of the Virgin Mary, who in her many representations throughout the history of art, represents women from every age and circumstance who wait patiently, joyfully or despairingly for a promise not yet fulfilled.  The garden is meticulously created by cutting and layering old botanical illustrations and depicted in different seasons that represent the passing of time as well as the natural cycle of waiting.
