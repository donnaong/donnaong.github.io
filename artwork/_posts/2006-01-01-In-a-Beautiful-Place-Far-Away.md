Dandelions are associated with the idea of the wish, the desire for flight and the dream of escape.  “In a Beautiful Place Far Away”, dandelion seeds are carefully and meticulously drawn using technical pen.  This precise method of drawing is often used in the fields of architecture and engineering, to depict buildings and objects that have been imagined but have not yet been realized in reality.  The seeds have just been blown off the flower head, and aided by the wind are floating away to far off places to germinate and begin their new phase of life as a brand new plant.
