Size
: 12 x 15 x 4m

Medium
: Army beds, mattress, bedding and wires

Exhibition
: Gillman Barracks (14 Sept – 30 Nov 2012), Opening Exhibition, Singapore

This is a site-specific work made in response to the location, a former army barracks that housed Singapore’s army recruits. Army beds swing gently in the air, some rising higher than others. Viewers are allowed to sit or lie down on the beds, the gentle swaying motion experienced, alluding to sleep, childhood and dreams of flight and escape.
