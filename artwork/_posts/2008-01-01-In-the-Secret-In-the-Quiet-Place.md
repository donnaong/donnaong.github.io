“In the Secret, In the Quiet Place” is a series of eight miniature installations placed within the rectangular openings of a standard shelf.   Made in response to the artist’s three-month stay in Japan under a residency programme, they reflect the uniquely “Japanese” living conditions– the intensely private, secret interior both metaphorically and physically; the cramped living conditions of Tokyo city life; the solitude and loneliness of the outsider and the rich imaginative fantasy worlds the Japanese dream up and inhabit so easily.
