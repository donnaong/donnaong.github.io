Entering the old chapel, one ascends a narrow staircase into a dimly lit attic.  Tucked away in one corner of the room is a strange contraption lit by an eclectic assortment of lamps.  The warm glow illuminates and describes dusty glass containers connected by rubber tubes, ornamental stands and large crystal bowls.  Tepid brackish water bubbles within the transparent receptacles, bringing to mind a mad scientific experiment.  However, unlike a real experiment, there is no transformation nor result.  The water remains stagnant and still within their individual containers, suspended forever in time and purpose.
