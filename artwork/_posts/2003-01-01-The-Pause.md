A small black room made out of discarded office furniture stands in the centre of a large white room.  Black wooden tables, shelves and cabinets define the boundaries of the room and create a permeable space that vacillates between sculpture and architecture.

The reduced monochromatic palette of the interior gives the work a surreal feel and the sense of unreality.  In fact, the room replicates not a real physical space, but attempts to create a psychological space, the space within a person’s mind but represented physically as a room and objects.

Many objects are repeated in the space – multiple light bulbs, pipes, etc.  Also, forms and shapes are echoed throughout the space in different sizes and materials.  This gives the space a slightly maniac and obsessive quality, which gives the audience further insight into the work and the mind it represents.
